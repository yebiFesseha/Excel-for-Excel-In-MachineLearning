LinReg: Basic linear regression ML, I have used list comprhension in a number of places to illustrate the beauty of python.

Logistic Regression: Run a Logistic Regression on soccer matches data, using Column Transformers and Pipeline. Used OneHotEncoding and svm.SVR for modelling and got 63% accuracy

Random Forest Classifier: random forest model for Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data, work in progress. This is just the beginning of the journey.

Support Vector Machine: run a svm.SVC with 4 kernels and svm.SVR with linear kernel and a bunch of thresholds.

Gradient Descent: an attempt to understand Gradient Descent
