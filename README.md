LinReg: Basic linear regression ML, I have used list comprhension in a number of places to illustrate the beauty of python.

Logistic Regression: Run a Logistic Regression on soccer matches data, using Column Transformers and Pipeline. Used OneHotEncoding and svm.SVR for modelling and got 63% accuracy

Random Forest Classifier: random forest model for Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data, work in progress. This is just the beginning of the journey.

Support Vector Machine: run a svm.SVC with 4 kernels and svm.SVR with linear kernel and a bunch of thresholds.

Gradient Descent: an attempt to understand Gradient Descent

Categorical: Here I am showing how a categorical data can be transformed and encoded before running an ML algoithm. The data is ficitious with a number of categorical columns. Support Vector Machine with SVC, Linear Regression and Decision Tree Classifier have been used for prediction and their accuracy has been measured against the test data.

K-Fold Cross Validation: I have run a number of models with k-fold CV and used pipeline.

First NLP project using NLTK and Regex: I used a Twitter comment data I got from Kaggle. The goal here is to get familiar with the available NLP libraries and create a Word Cloud.

How to execute SQLite3 commands: SQL is a critical skill for a data analyst or scientist to have. In here i have demonstrated basic execution of sqlite commands using python/pandas. I have created a fictious database with 3 tables. Populated two of them with data. The third one I showed how to remove or drop it from the database. I have also read a table from the database using Pandas.
